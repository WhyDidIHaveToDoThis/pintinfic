Just wanted a tool that will help me easily mark which fics i've read and need to go back and give kudos to.
I decided I needed a ~~pinterest board~~ ~~a spreadsheet~~ ~~tinder~~ this thing to organize my library.

## Thanks

I used this template https://github.com/CodeSteppe/card-swiper and way too much chatgpt to make this.
